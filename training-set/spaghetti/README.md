Most of this might as well be magic.  Do not worry about this directory too much.  It contains scripts that are meant to paste together unorganized pieces of information in our training sets.

It is included in version control anyways so that:  

 1. Any useful scripts/commands can be accessable for future reference  
 2. Our work can be validated when/if something goes wrong  
 3. Evidence of hours worked (for the purpose of documenting a school project)
